# AHP-based-smartphone-ranking
A simple python script that imports the feature data about different smartphones from an excel file, takes user input on the preference ratings, and then applies the AHP algorithm to rank the alternatives acc to the user preference.
# Main working file: AHP.py

# Dependencies
* Python-3.X
* xlrd

I know that I should club all this under a common class and than instantiate an object as that will be much cleaner, but since this is just a fun project, I do not intend to restrucutre the code anymore :)
